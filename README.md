# ShapeAndSize Library

The ShapeAndSize library is a Python library built using matplotlib that allows users to plot various geometric shapes like squares, rectangles, triangles, and more based on user input. It also provides functionalities to calculate the area, perimeter, diagonal, and other properties of these shapes.

## Features

- **Square**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and diagonal of a square.
- **Rectangle**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and diagonal of a rectangle.
- **Triangle**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and height of a triangle.
- **Equilateral Triangle**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and height of an equilateral triangle.
- **Parallelogram**: Plot and compute area and perimeter of a parallelogram.
- **Rhombus**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and side of a rhombus.
- **Trapezoid**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and side of a trapezoid.
- **Kite**: Plot and compute area, perimeter, and sides of a kite.
- **Regular Polygon**: Plot and compute properties of polygons with any number of sides.
- **Semi-Circle**: Plot and compute area, circumference, and diameter of a semi-circle.
- **Circle**: Plot and compute area, circumference, and diameter of a circle.
- **Star**: Plot a star shape.

## Installation

You can install the ShapeAndSize library using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install ShapeAndSize
\`\`\`

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the ShapeAndSize library to plot a square:

\`\`\`python
from ShapeAndSize import square

# Plot a square with side length 5
square.plot(5)
\`\`\`

## Documentation

### Square

#### Methods

- **plot(side, marker='none', linestyle='solid', color='m')**: Plot a square with the specified side length, marker, linestyle, and color.
- **area(side)**: Calculate the area of the square.
- **perimeter(side)**: Calculate the perimeter of the square.
- **diagonal(side)**: Calculate the diagonal of the square.

### Rectangle, Triangle, Equilateral Triangle, Parallelogram, Rhombus, Trapezoid, Kite, Regular Polygon, Semi-Circle, Circle, Star

Similar methods are available for each shape to plot and calculate their properties.
